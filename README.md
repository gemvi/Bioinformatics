## Welcome to the GeMVi project WP3: Genomic sequencing and bioinformatics capacity and development Pages

In this WP, we will:

 - Enhance KWTRP capacity to become a leader in virus genomics in East Africa. We will also be strengthening links between, and capacity of, KWTRP, UVRI and KCRI, establishing a regional hub for virus pathogen genomics. 

 - Build on existing capacity. Enhance the Kilifi-Bioinformatics department through technical appointments and hardware and software upgrading to a required level of computing capability for expected increased users. 

- Develop joint bioinformatic and epidemiology pipelines. Develop pipelines for processing and analysis of short read data for virus pathogens which feed directly into epidemiological inference. Open source software will be used. 

- Use new sequencing formats. Develop use and transfer of new sequence technology. In particular the compact Oxford Nanopore real-time sequencer (set up at KWTRP in Kenya); a relative low-cost option highly suited to outbreak investigation (12).
